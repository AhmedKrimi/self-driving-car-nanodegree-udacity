The most stable feature from the point-cloud prespective is the rear bumper of the vehicles since the first reflection of the beam comes from it. Additional features like the vehicles front lights can be detected using the lidar intensity channel. Finally, it is easily to recognize a car from its chassis using the point-cloud.


# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?


### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 


### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?


### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
